## Quality Standards

- **Actionable recommendations** — No generic advice; specific next steps with context
- **Quantitative scoring** — Include metrics, scores, or ratings where applicable
- **Go/no-go recommendations** — Clear decision guidance backed by analysis

### Code Quality

- Skills must be self-contained markdown files
- Follow existing naming conventions: `XX-skill-name.md`
