2. Register domain (stratarray.com)
3. Create GitHub organization: `github.com/maigent/stratarray`

## Questions to Answer

- [x] Which name resonates most with you? **StratArray**
- [ ] Do you have 3 business ideas to test skills with?
- [ ] Do you know 5-10 people who could beta test?
- [ ] Preferred launch timeline (10 weeks or slower)?
- [ ] Any specific advanced packs to prioritize after launch?

---

## Why This Will Work

1. **You've already built the blueprint** (INIMINI used these exact frameworks)
2. **Proven demand** (founders pay $5K+ for business consultants)
3. **First-mover advantage** (no comprehensive business strategy skills exist yet)
4. **Freemium funnel** (free tier builds trust → paid tiers monetize)
5. **Scalable** (markdown skills = zero marginal cost)
6. **You understand the market** (you're building INIMINI, you know the founder journey)

**Ready to Start?**

Name is chosen: **StratArray**. Next: register the domain and let's build the first skill: `idea-validator`
